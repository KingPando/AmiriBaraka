            <h3>Early Life</h3><hr class="divider">
            <p>
                Amiri Baraka, previously known as LeRoi Jones, was born in Newark, NJ on Oct. 7, 1934
                and died Jan. 9, 2014, was an African American writer and activist.

                In 1954, he served in the US Air Force for 3 years, but was dishonorably charged when his commanding
                officer found Soviet writings in Baraka's possession. Working in a library he found his passion for
                poetry inspired by Beat poets.  Central elements of Beat culture are rejection of standard narrative
                values, spiritual quest, exploration of American and Eastern religions, rejection of materialism,
                explicit portrayals of the human condition, experimentation with psychedelic drugs, and sexual
                liberation and exploration.

            <h3>Activism and Controversy</h3><hr class="divider">
            <p>
                After the murder of Malcolm X in 1965, Jones transitioned from his Beat identity another. He changed his
                name to Imamu Amiri Baraka, embracing the Black liberation ideology.
                Malcolm X's murder also marks the point in Baraka's career where charges of racism, homophobia, and
                anti-Semitism were made against him. One such works was of Baraka's popular Harlem street performances
                in 1965 involved a Black valet murdering white victims. From 1965 to 1974, Baraka devoted himself to the Black Nationalist
                cause and the Congress of Afrikan Peoples.
                Much of his works were focused on civil rights, he critized the pacifist civil rights movements,
                preffering more radical movements instead. Later, Baraka co-founded The Black Arts Repertory Theater (BART). The goal was to
                "create an art that would be a weapon in the Black Liberation Movement."
                Time magazine once described this Black Arts Movement as the most controversial moment in history of
                African-American literature.
                Another uproar occurred in 2002, with Baraka's poem "Somebody Blew Up America", where many critized him
                for being a Anti-semite. This event cost him his position as poet laureate in NJ.
